# Student Performance Prediction (Machine Learning)

## 📌 Project Overview
This project applies **Machine Learning** to predict student GPA based on lifestyle and study-related factors.  
The aim is to explore how variables such as **study hours, sleep, extracurricular activities, social life, and stress levels** impact academic performance.  

This work was developed as part of my **Higher Diploma in Data Analytics for Business** (CCT College, Dublin).

## 🎯 Objectives
- Perform **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** to understand patterns in lifestyle and academic performance.  
- Build and compare **Machine Learning models** (Random Forest, Logistic Regression, SVM).  
- Apply **data preprocessing, feature engineering, and balancing (SMOTE)**.  
- Evaluate models with accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.  
- Generate insights for **academic performance improvement strategies**.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- **Python**  
- **Pandas, NumPy** – data preprocessing and manipulation  
- **Matplotlib, Seaborn** – data visualization  
- **Scikit-learn** – machine learning models & evaluation  
- **Jupyter Notebook** – analysis & implementation

## 📊 Key Results
- Built predictive models with **Random Forest and Logistic Regression**.  
- Applied **SMOTE** to balance dataset and improve model generalization.  
- Random Forest achieved the best balance of **accuracy and interpretability**.  
- Visualized correlations between study habits, lifestyle, and GPA outcomes.
